    "description": "Today Affordable housing finance companies have grown rapidly to build a loan portfolio of Rs. 745 billion, however, if one is self-employed, and without comprehensive documented income or adequate credit history, getting a home loan can prove to be a huge challenge. This is because of traditional lenders, in the current eco-system, find it difficult to ‘fit’ the average person’s case into their income assessment methods. Vastu Housing Finance is a housing finance company that addresses this gap by using a combination of technology and the traditional distribution model to provide simple, easy and flexible loans. Through its unique ability to acquire and underwrite large volumes of such loans, Vastu serves the under-served community.",
